# chess-with-linear-time-travel
A version of chess where you can time travel.  
Inspired by 5D Chess with Multiverse Time Travel.  

## Installation
As of right now, the game is not in a playable state. When it is, this section will be updated to show how to install the game.

## How does it work?
Chess with Linear Time Travel works mostly like normal chess, except you can send pieces back in time. However, this dodges paradoxes by making any moves that would cause a paradox illegal.
